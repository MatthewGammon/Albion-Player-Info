# Important Info
This is a hobby project being built by an aspiring developer. 
It is unlikely that this project will ever be used by the public, but instead is being developed for personal and possible internal guild use. 

Any feedback and/or contributions are welcomed!

# Project Goals

This project will be a full stack web application that consumes both third party APIs and custom endpoints.
A user will be able to type in their character's name and have information about that character displayed such as:
* Guild and Alliance Name
* Kill and Death Fame
* 10 Most Recent Kills and Deaths

Each Kill and Death will link to a page that displays specific information about that battle such as:
* Number of participants
* Gear worn by Killer and Victim
* Items in inventory on death
