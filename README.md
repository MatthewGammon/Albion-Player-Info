# Project Goals

This project will be a full stack web application that consumes both third party APIs and custom endpoints.
A user will be able to type in their character's name and have information about that character displayed such as:
* Guild and Alliance Name
* Kill and Death Fame
* 10 Most Recent Kills and Deaths

Each Kill and Death will link to a page that displays specific information about that battle such as:
* Number of participants
* Gear worn by Killer and Victim
* Items in inventory on death
